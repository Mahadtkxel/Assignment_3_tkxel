For Ansible roles, you can see your Ansible course from Kodekloud: 

- Push your terraform (VNet, VM, Blob) code to GitHub
- Provision VM, VNet, and blob storage using Terraform. Please follow the best practices of Terraform 
- Write GitHub action (CI/CD) to provision the infrastructure on Azure
- Also, destroy the provisioned infrastructure using the GitHub Action after the below points are done 
- Connect to provisioned VM instance from local and run ansible role to install nginx docker and docker-compose. Each ansible role should be separate for each installer
- Write a separate role that will change the nginx port from 80 to 81
